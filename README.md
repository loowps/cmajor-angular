# Cmajor + Angular

![cmajorpatch screenshot](screenshot.png)

Proof of concept [cmajor] gain fx patch with [angular] gui.

Use npm build and afterwards load the .cmajorpatch within the dist directory via the cmaj plugin within a daw.

Angular 15 with standalone components, jest, eslint, prettier, husky + lintstaged.

#### Known issues

- patch run in vscode does not display any gui (probably caused by the iframe, loading the patch via cmajor plugin in a daw works)
- the pointer lock api causes a notification within the webview to use the ESC button
