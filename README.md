# Cmajor + Angular

![cmajorpatch screenshot](screenshot.png)

Proof of concept [cmajor] gain fx patch with [angular] gui built to a single web component.

To test the patch simply run `npm install` and `npm run build`. Afterward drag the .cmajorpatch from
the dist directory to the cmaj-plugin within your daw or play the patch via the cmaj command line tool.

For development use `npm start` to rebuild the patch on change.

Setup: Angular 17 and [angular-elements], jest, eslint, prettier, husky + lintstaged
Tested with Cmajor Version: 0.9.2233 running the cmaj-plugin in Bitwig v5.0.11 on Windows 10.

#### Known issues / future improvements

- currently running the patch via the vscode extension does not seem to work
- the pointer lock api causes a notification within the webview to use the ESC button
- when loading a patch the default values don't seem to be reflected inside the host
