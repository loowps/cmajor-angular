# Cmajor + Angular

![cmajorpatch screenshot](screenshot.png)

Proof of concept [cmajor] gain fx patch with [angular] gui.

Use `npm run build` and afterwards load the .cmajorpatch within the dist directory via the cmaj plugin within a daw.

Angular 15 with standalone components, jest, eslint, prettier, husky + lintstaged.

#### Known issues / future improvements

- patch run in vscode does not display any gui (probably caused by the iframe, loading the patch via cmajor plugin in a
  daw works)
- with `npm run watch` the patch is rebuild on change, but you have to manually reload the patch inside the plugin
- the pointer lock api causes a notification within the webview to use the ESC button
- when loading a patch the default values don't seem to be reflected inside the host (this also happens with other
  example patches without custom gui)
